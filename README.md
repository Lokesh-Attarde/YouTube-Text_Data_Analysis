# üí° Conclusions
* In terms of "Resort Hotel", "PRT" is dominated by around "35.2%" of Guests followed by "GBR" and "ESP" having "20.5%" and "10.7%" of guests respectively.
* "PRT" (Portugal) has the Maximum Number of Guest of around '21.071K' followed by "GBR" (United Kingdom) I.e. UK and "FRA" (France) having '9.67K' and '8.48K' Number of Guests respectively.
* There is a significant rise of Number of Guests in terms of "PRT", "GBR", and "FRA" from the Year 2015 to 2016. However, again in the Year 2016 to 2017, the Number of Guests proportion has declined rapidly.
* "A" Category Room, are having Highest Price approx. '500 EUR'. Whereas with respect to this "G" Category Room as well, will see that 'City Hotel Rooms' are Much 'Costlier' than All other Rooms.
* "Resort Hotel Prices" are much Higher during the 'Summer', whereas at the same time, "Prices" of a "City Hotel" doesn't varied that much.
   On the other hand, "City Hotels" are Expensive during the 'Spring' or 'Autumn' Season (i.e. In 'May' and 'August').
* Almost "77.3%" of the Bookings are definitely prefer 'Bed & Breakfast'. Secondly, 'Half Board' (Breakfast and Dinner) kind of Meal's were prefered by around "12.1%" of guests and "8.92%" of guests prefer 'Self-Catering' (No Meals) kind of Bookings.

   Or Almost "50%" of the Bookings don't have any kind of 'Special Requests'.
* In terms of "City Hotel", We have More Guests during the 'Autumn' & 'Spring' Season when the Prices are also 'Highest'. 
    * Whereas In terms of our "Resort Hotel", the 'Most busiest Month' is "August" followed by "July" & "October".
    * In a Nutshell, Will can say, both the Hotels have the Fewest Guests during the "Winter" (i.e. Jan, Nov & Dec) And although Prices are also Lower.
* Majority of People are prefer to Stay in the "City Hotel", mostly for '3' Nights. It might because of the "Prices" of a "City Hotel" doesn't varied much when we compared it with "Resort Hotel".
* "Online TA" is going to Dominate on each and every Category of Market Segment by '47.5%'. We can also say that, Almost "50%" of the Bookings are takes place in this "Online" way.
* Almost "75%" of Cancel Bookings are with respect to our "City Hotel, whereas "25%" are with respect to our "Resort Hotel Bookings".
